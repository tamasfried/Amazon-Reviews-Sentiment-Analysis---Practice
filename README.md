# Amazon Reviews Sentiment Analysis - Practice
Practice before I start my actual masters project for Sentiment Analysis

## Dataset
- Source: [Amazon Reviews for Sentiment Analysis on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bittlingmayer/amazonreviews)
- Download the dataset from Kaggle (requires a free Kaggle account) and extract the archive.
- Copy the `test.ft.txt` file (or other files you plan to use) into the `amazon_reviews_kaggle/` directory in this repository.
- Large data files are not tracked in Git; if you need to version them, consider using Git LFS or storing them separately.

## Getting Started
Once the dataset is in place you can iterate locally on notebooks or scripts for preprocessing and modelling without committing the large source data to GitHub.
